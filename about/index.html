        <p> I am currently very proficient in java but as of the end of this semester will have completed coursework in
            databases and a project based on raspberry pis and python. I would work diligently on all projects and push
            myself to learn as much about the industry and software as possible. I specifically would love the opportunity
            to work on any projects involving scripting languages as I have little experience in that field and am
            starting to love python.</p>
        <p>Thank you again for the consideration of my employment,</p>
        <p>-Andrew Cantrell</p>
